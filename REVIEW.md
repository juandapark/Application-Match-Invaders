# Project Review

<!-- Your review goes here -->

-I really enjoyed coding the game, it was challenging, my biggest obstacle was time,  to code it in the 6 to 8 hour mark meeting all the requirements and bonus points was almost near impossible, I was more close around the 10- 11 hour mark to be honest.

-I did not manage to implement the automated tests, this is something I have not come across before, therefore to implement this I would need to spend more time learning how to do it, this would have made the test longer so I decided the skip this and come clean about it (I will learn about this for sure now :) ).


<!-- Explain why you did the things that way or any snippet that is word mentioning -->

-I was trying to code things as quick as possible and keeping the classes as short as possible.


-I wanted to replicate the space invaders movement, this was the most challenging bit I would say. The enemies move in units rather than speed, the speed of the enemies are based on the length of the array in the enemy manager class, 
The shorter the array the quicker they move.

-I did not use animators, I think the animations are simple enough to handle from code, this is to avoid the overhead with animations.


<!-- If you had any issue and how you resolved them -->

-one of the major issues I had was trying to replicate the space invaders movement, the enemies kept going out of sync, then I decided to not move the enemies from their class but make the movement come from the manager class, 
So that all the enemies can be In sync.

-The other issue was with the fibonacci formula, I had not come across this before, therefore I had to do some research about it first, before implementation.
